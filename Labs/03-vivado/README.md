## Two-bit wide 4-to-1 multiplexer
### VHDL achitecture
```vhdl
architecture Behavioral of mux_2bit_4to1 is
begin

    f_o <= a_i when (sel_i = "00") else
           b_i when (sel_i = "01") else
           c_i when (sel_i = "10") else
           d_i;

end Behavioral;
```
### VHDL stimulus process
```vhdl
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    -- Data generation process
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    p_stimulus : process
    begin
        -- Report a note at the begining of stimulus process
        report "Stimulus process started" severity note;

        s_d <= "00"; s_c <= "00"; s_b <= "00"; s_a <= "11"; 
        s_sel <= "00"; wait for 100 ns;
        
        s_d <= "00"; s_c <= "00"; s_b <= "10"; s_a <= "00"; 
        s_sel <= "01"; wait for 100 ns;
        
        s_d <= "00"; s_c <= "01"; s_b <= "00"; s_a <= "00"; 
        s_sel <= "10"; wait for 100 ns;
        
        s_d <= "11"; s_c <= "00"; s_b <= "00"; s_a <= "00"; 
        s_sel <= "11"; wait for 100 ns;

        s_sel <= "11"; wait for 100 ns;
        
        -- Report a note at the end of stimulus process
        report "Stimulus process finished" severity note;
        wait;
